pb-archive - archive your pinboard.in bookmarks
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
pb-archive [\f[I]options\f[]] -u username -t security_token
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
pb-archive creates a backup of your pinboard.in bookmarks.
Bookmarks are then archived along with all other page requisites such as
css files.
Archived pages are laid out on the local filesystem according to the
bookmarked url.
A report is created which holds the description, original url,
filesystem location and all user set tags.
.PP
Interaction with Pinboard is done through their v1 api.
pb-archive will only use your username and security token and will not
use your password.
You can easily reset your token at anytime.
You can hard code your username and token into the pb-archive file in
the constructor of the Configuration class.
.PP
All bookmarks with implicit extensions will have extensions added.
Archived files are rewritten for local viewing.
A copy of each is made and will have the \[aq].orig\[aq] extension.
