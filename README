            pb-archive - pinboard.in bookmark archiver
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Intro:
    pb-archive archives your pinboard.in bookmarks as well as all page requisites.
    
Directions:
    * Directions on usage can be found in the man page man/pb-archive.1
        > man man/pb-archive.1
    * Tested to work on Python 2.7 and Python 3. Requires wget(1) and
        python argparse module.
    * Use pandoc to build man pages
        pandoc -s -w man pb-archive.1.md -o pb-archive.1

Design:
    * wget(1) was chosen over urllib2 as to not reinvent the wheel. wget does a 
      very good job at archiving/mirroring so it only made sense to take
      advantage of that.
